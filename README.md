# DeFi Lending Platform

A comprehensive DeFi lending platform that enables banks to pool money and customers to borrow based on a multi-factor credit scoring system combining on-chain, off-chain (via Flare FDC), and referral-based scoring.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Credit Scoring System**
   - **On-chain Score**: Based on blockchain transaction history and DeFi activity
   - **Off-chain Score**: Traditional credit data via Experian API ‚Üí Web2JSON FDC mapping
   - **Referral Score**: Social credit scoring via The Graph protocol

2. **User Interface**
   - Account creation with SSN verification
   - Circle integration for on-chain verification
   - Unique wallet generation per user
   - Credit score dashboard with breakdowns
   - Loan application and management
   - Referral system

3. **Bank Interface**
   - Wallet connection for banks
   - APY monitoring and returns tracking
   - Money pooling and management
   - Default protection via insurance pool

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd hackathon-project

# Install dependencies for all packages
npm run install:all

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

This will start:

   - Multiple test profiles with different credit scores
   - Comprehensive credit factors (payment history, utilization, etc.)
   - Mock account and inquiry data

2. **Web2JSON FDC Integration**
   - Flare Data Connector integration
   - Off-chain to on-chain data mapping
   - Attestation proof generation
   - Merkle proof system for verification
   - Smart contract ready data formatting

3. **API Infrastructure**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Complete credit score flow
   - Error handling and validation
   - Comprehensive documentation

### üîÑ In Progress

- Wallet generation service
- On-chain credit scoring logic
- The Graph integration for referrals

### üìã Planned Features

- Frontend user interface
- Bank management dashboard
- Smart contract deployment
- Insurance pool implementation
- Loan approval automation

## üß™ Testing the Current Implementation

### Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js &
```

The server will start on http://localhost:3001

### Run the Interactive Demo

```bash
cd backend
node demo.js
```

This interactive demo showcases:
- Complete credit scoring pipeline for 3 different user profiles
- Experian API integration with realistic credit reports
- Web2JSON FDC attestation with cryptographic proofs
- Smart contract ready data generation

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
cd backend
node test/testFlow.js
```

This comprehensive test suite validates:
- Health check endpoint
- Mock Experian API calls
- Web2JSON attestation process
- Complete credit score flow
- All API endpoints

### API Endpoints

#### Health Check
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/health
```

#### Get Mock Test Data
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/credit-score/mock-data
```

#### Complete Credit Score Flow
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/credit-score/complete-flow
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ssn": "123-45-6789",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-15",
  "userAddress": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9d1E6b0Db1d46"
}
```

## üîß Configuration
