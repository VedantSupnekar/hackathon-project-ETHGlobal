# 🛠️ Issues Fixed - Complete Resolution

## ✅ **All Issues Resolved Successfully**

### **1. Duplicate SSN/Name Input Issue** 
- **Problem**: SSN and name were being asked again in the off-chain score modal
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `firstName` and `lastName` from `offChainData` state
  - Updated modal to show user's account details instead of asking again
  - Added info box showing: "Using your account details: Name: {firstName} {lastName}"
  - Only ask for SSN since that's the unique identifier for Experian

### **2. ABI Coder Error** 
- **Problem**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'defaultAbiCoder')`
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed ethers.js v5 compatibility in `backend/services/fdcWeb2JsonService.js`
  - Changed `ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder()` → `ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder`
  - This was the last remaining ethers.js compatibility issue

### **3. Database Reset for Demo**
- **Problem**: No way to clear user data during demo
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `resetAllData()` method to `UserPortfolioService`
  - Added `getSystemStats()` method for monitoring
  - Created API endpoints: 
    - `POST /api/portfolio/demo/reset` - Reset all data
    - `GET /api/portfolio/demo/stats` - Get system statistics
  - Added frontend demo reset button with confirmation modal
  - Reset clears: users, wallets, scores, and logs out current user

### **4. Missing MetaMaskConnector Component**
- **Problem**: Frontend was importing non-existent MetaMaskConnector
- **Solution**: 
  - Created complete `MetaMaskConnector.tsx` component
  - Handles MetaMask detection, connection, network switching
  - Configured for Chain ID 31337 (Ganache)
  - Shows connection status, balance, and account info
  - Auto-switches to local network if needed

## 🎯 **Current System Status**

### **✅ All Services Running:**
- **Ganache**: Chain ID 31337 (0x7a69) ✅
- **Backend**: Port 3001 with all fixes ✅  
- **Frontend**: Port 3000 with MetaMask integration ✅

### **✅ Fixed Functionality:**
