## üé¨ **Perfect Judge Demo Script**

### **1. Opening Hook** (30 seconds)
*"Traditional DeFi only sees one wallet per user - but real users have multiple wallets for different activities. I solved this with multi-wallet portfolio analysis combined with real Flare FDC Web2JSON integration."*

### **2. User X Demo** (2 minutes)
*"Let me show you User X who has 3 wallets representing different crypto activities:"*

**Live Demo Commands:**
```bash
# Register User X
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio/register \
-d '{"email": "userx@demo.com", "password": "DemoX123!", "firstName": "User", "lastName": "X", "ssn": "111-11-1111"}'

# Link Wallet 1 (Excellent) - Score: 661
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio/link-wallet \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
-d '{"walletAddress": "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"}'

# Link Wallet 2 (Premium) - Portfolio becomes: 690
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio/link-wallet \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
-d '{"walletAddress": "0x14dC79964da2C08b23698B3D3cc7Ca32193d9955"}'

# Link Wallet 3 (Bad) - Portfolio drops to: 568
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio/link-wallet \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
-d '{"walletAddress": "0x15d34AAf54267DB7D7c367839AAf71A00a2C6A65"}'
```

**Judge Talking Points:**
- *"Watch the aggregated score change as each wallet is added"*
- *"2 excellent wallets (661, 719) offset 1 bad wallet (325)"*
- *"Final aggregated on-chain score: 568"*

### **3. FDC Web2JSON Integration** (1 minute)
```bash
# Set off-chain score via real FDC
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio/set-offchain-score \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
-d '{"ssn": "111-11-1111", "firstName": "User", "lastName": "X"}'
```

**Judge Talking Points:**
- *"Single SSN maps to traditional credit score: 820"*
- *"Real Flare FDC Web2JSON - see the attestation ID and cryptographic proofs"*
- *"Off-chain score applies to entire user, not individual wallets"*

### **4. Final Composite Score** (1 minute)
```bash
# Get final portfolio analysis
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio/scores \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "scores": {
    "onChain": 568,
    "offChain": 820,
    "composite": 744
  },

      {"address": "0x15d...", "score": 325, "profile": "BAD"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Judge Talking Points:**
- *"Composite score: 744 = (568√ó30%) + (820√ó70%)"*
- *"Multi-wallet portfolio analysis complete"*
- *"Ready for production lending decisions"*
